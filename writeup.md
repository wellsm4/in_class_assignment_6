## Question

Do countries with more Steam game players generate higher XP (experience) per hour on the platform?

## Answer

According to the analysis run in Python, there is very little correlation between these two variables. The scatterplot shows no line to speak of, hinting to little to no linear correlation. Resultingly, the correlation matrix gives a value of about 0.013 for the correlation between those two values, suggesting almost zero correlation exists, and certainly not within any reasonable level of confidence.
